Cloud-0 is a Cloud cost optimizer that helps organizations manage and reduce their spending on cloud computing services. It does this by analyzing an organization's usage of cloud resources and identifying ways to optimize that usage to reduce costs. For example, a cloud-0  might suggest turning off idle resources or using lower-cost options for certain types of workloads. By using a cloud-0 cost optimizer, organizations can save money on their cloud computing bills and better manage their cloud expenses.
